I'm Jolene, a software engineer at Cisco Umbrella on the Data Platform team.

# Technical interests:
- I like doing all sorts of stuff and have been lucky to wear many hats at my current role at Cisco
- I enjoy working on interesting challenges and learning new things
- Currently I help develop, maintain, and monitor the data pipeline and storage for the Reporting UI at Cisco Umbrella. 
- I am familiar with using aws, terraform, ansible, python, golang, bash, clickhouse, nagios, and kafka to help with my day to day
