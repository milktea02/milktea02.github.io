![Me, but a dinosaur](/assets/profile.jpg)

I'm Jolene, a senior software engineer at Cisco Umbrella on the Data Platform team.

# Links:
- [DEV.to](https://dev.to/milktea02) - Brain to keyboard to post pipeline
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wongjl) - I was told this was a good place to find a job
- [Github](https://github.com/milktea02) - Project wasteland
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jwowo_uwu) - Something about reply guys

# Technical interests:
- I like doing all sorts of stuff and have been lucky to wear many hats at my current role at Cisco where I get to work on interesting challenges and have learned many new things
- Currently I help develop, maintain, and monitor the data pipeline and storage that powers the data behind the Reporting API at Cisco Umbrella. 
- I am familiar with using aws, terraform, ansible, python, golang, bash, clickhouse, nagios, and kafka to help with my day to day
- I mainly work in a Unix/Linux environment and know how to exit out of `vim` but can't speak for `nano` or `emacs`


### Notes:
- Dinosaur me was drawn by my talented friend whom we refer to as Fish Goddess
- [A split keyboard](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) cured my wrist and shoulder pain (not really but it certainly helped)
- I can squat one (1) baby cow :cow2: (but not an actual baby cow, just the weight of one)
- I [once contributed to open source](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/pull/199). Hopefully it'll be twice, and thrice more!
